# IoTCodes
A collection of my Arduino projects, ranging from my beginner projects to probably my advanced builds. This repository will feature detailed code, schematics, and documentation for each project, providing a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning and experimenting with IoT (Arduino, raspberry Pi etc)
