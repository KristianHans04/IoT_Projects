Project Overview: Develop an IoT-based predictive maintenance system that monitors various sensors (e.g., vibration, temperature, and humidity) on industrial machines. The goal is to predict potential machine failures using advanced statistical methods such as time series analysis, regression models, and machine learning techniques like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

Overally, the project involves:
	o	Data Collection: I used IoT sensors (e.g., temperature, vibration, and sound) to gather real-time data from industrial machines.
	o	Data Transmission: Sending data to a cloud platform using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) or HTTP protocols.
	o	Data Analysis: Performing advanced time series analysis and machine learning to predict failures based on changes in the data patterns.
	o	Prediction and Alerting: Used models to predict failures and trigger alerts when anomalies are detected, preventing unexpected downtime.

Mathematical Concepts Involved:
	•	Time Series Analysis: Implemented ARIMA models for forecasting time-based sensor data.
	•	Multivariate Regression: Analyzed the relationship between multiple sensor readings (vibration, temperature) and failure probability.
	•	Machine Learning: Used LSTM models for deep learning on time-series data to identify non-linear patterns.
	•	Fourier Transform: Apply Fourier analysis to identify frequency-based anomalies in vibration data.

Hardware & Software Requirements:
	•	Hardware: IoT microcontroller, sensors (temperature, vibration, sound sensors), network module (for MQTT).
	•	Software: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM), Statsmodels (for ARIMA), MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto), NumPy, and Pandas for data manipulation.
